        <p>Succulents are a drought tolerant variety of plant with thick, fleshy leaves. They are fun to take care of, aesthetically pleasing, and can even reduce stress! This webpage will teach you how to take care of succulents, the different types of succulents, and some interesting facts about these fascinating plants. Enjoy!<br><br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Eze_jardin_exotique.JPG" alt="Some cool lookin' succulents" width="400"> <p><em>This is an example of a lovely outdoor cactus and succulent garden. Yep, they can survive indoors AND outdoors!</em></p></p>
    
    <h2>Care</h2>
    <h3>Potting</h3>
        <p>Plants will generally survive inside the plastic containers that you bought them in, but they can be replanted in a different container if you feel the need to. Here are the steps to successfully repotting a succulent:<ol><li>Carefully loosen the soil by squeezing the container on opposite sides.</li><li>Remove the succulent from its container, trying to keep as much of the soil intact as possible.</li><li>Insert the succulent into the new pot, adding more soil if needed. Water it a little so the soil can pack down.</li></ol><ul><li>Make sure to pay extra attention to a newly potted succulent, watering them when needed and providing them with ample sunlight so they can adjust to their new pot.</li></ul><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Baobob_tree.jpg"alt="Believe it or not, this huge Adansonia digitata is classified as a stem succulent!" width="200"><br><em>Believe it or not, this huge <strong>Adansonia digitata </strong>is classified as a stem succulent!</em>
    <h3>Watering</h3>
        <p>Succulents need to watered every couple weeks, or whenever the soil is dry to the touch. As you can tell from the photo below, succulents' leaves are primarily made of water, so you will be able to tell if you have neglected your succulents because the leaves will start to shrivel up.Water succulents with a gentle stream of water, so the leaves aren't damaged, and make sure the soil is soaked through.</p>
            <ul><li>Keep in mind that succulents in pots with drainage holes will be easier to take care of because you can tell how much you have watered them based on the amount of water leaving the base of the pot. With pots without drainage holes, there's a possibility of the succulent being overwatered and the water sitting at the bottom of the pot and causing the succulent's roots to rot.</li></ul><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Split_Aloe.jpg"alt="Succulent plants, such as this Aloe, store water in their fleshy leaves"width="200"><br><p><em>Succulent plants, such as this <strong>Aloe</strong>, store water in their fleshy leaves.</em></p>
    <h3>Light</h3>
        <p>Succulents need a fair amount of sunlight to flourish. If a plant does not have access to enough sunlight, the leaves will visibly wilt and the plant will eventually die. In extremely hot locations, plants may need some afternoon shade so their leaves aren't scorched.</p><img src="http://pistilsnursery.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/care-for-succulents-pistils-nursery-5.jpg"alt="As you can see from the succulent on the left, when a succulent does not have access to enough light it starts to stretch to try and reach for more light.

This gives it a rather unsightly appearance, compared to the succulent on the right that is growing normally.</em></p>
    
    <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
        <p>Fertilizer isn't necessary to a healthy succulent, but it can help with freshly propagated or repotted succulents. A brand of your choice should be lightly sprinkled over the soil about once a month. Fertilizer can, however, burn your succulents leaves, as seen on the plant below.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Fertilizer-Burn.jpg"alt="Brownish blemishes on a plant's leaf demonstrate that it has suffered fertilizer burns."width="200"><br><em>Brownish blemishes on a plant's leaf demonstrate that it has suffered fertilizer burns.</em>

    <br><h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Succulents originate from dry desert locations that have long dry seasons, like Africa. This explains why they have adapted to store water in their, making them thick and fleshy.</li>
    <li>The word succulent comes from the Latin word "<em>sucus</em>", meaning juice or sap. It nods to the leaves that these plants are known for and that help them survive extreme drought and heat.</li>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Astroloba_tenax_6.jpg" alt="A Leaf Succulent: Asphodelaceae Astroloba tenax" width="150"><br><p><em>A Leaf Succulent: Asphodelaceae Astroloba tenax</em></p>
    <li>Succulents come in pretty much every color of the rainbow: obviously green, but even blue, purple, pink, orange, and red!</li>
    <li>Succulents are pretty much pest resistant, which is just one of the many reasons that they are extremely easy plants to care for! (If your really having trouble keeping them alive, it might be those pesky fungus gnats. See above)</li>
    <li>YOU CAN CREATE INFINITY SUCCULENTS WITH JUST ONE SUCCULENT. Here's the math: You can take one succulent and propagate it, or chop off the top part of it, let it dry, and then replant it with some good fertilizer. The section you cut off, or propagated, will grow into a new plant. Now you have two plants from the one you started with. If you let these fellas grow for a while, then you can propagate both of them. Now you have 4. Continue this process until you have infinity succulents.</li>
