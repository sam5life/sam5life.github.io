    <h3>Potting</h3>
        <p>Plants will generally survive inside the plastic containers that you bought them in, but they can be replanted in a different container if you feel the need to. Here are the steps to successfully repotting a succulent:
            <ol><li>Carefully loosen the soil by squeezing the container on opposite sides.</li>
                <li>Remove the succulent from its container, trying to keep as much of the soil intact as possible.</li>
                <li>Insert the succulent into the new pot, adding more soil if needed, and water it a little so the soil can pack down.</li>
            </ol>
            <ul><li>Make sure to pay extra attention to a newly potted succulent, watering them when needed and providing them with ample sunlight so they can adjust to their new pot.</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Watering</h3>
        <p>Succulents need to watered every couple weeks, or whenever the soil is dry to the touch. As you can tell from the photo below, succulents' leaves are primarily made of water, so you will be able to tell if you have neglected your succulents because the leaves will start to shrivel up. Water succulents with a gentle stream of water, so the leaves aren't damaged, and make sure the soil is soaked through.</p>
            <ul><li>Keep in mind that succulents in pots with drainage holes will be easier to take care of because you can tell how much you have watered them based on the amount of water leaving the base of the pot. With pots without drainage holes, there's a possibility of the succulent being overwatered and the water sitting at the bottom of the pot and causing the succulent's roots to rot.</li>

    <h3>Light</h3>
        <p>Succulents need a fair amount of sunlight to flourish. If a plant does not have access to enough sunlight, the leaves will visibly wilt and the plant will eventually die. In extremely hot locations, plants may need some afternoon shade so their leaves aren't scorched.</p>

    <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
        <p>Fertilizer isn't necessary to a healthy succulent, but it can help with freshly propagated or repotted succulents. A brand of your choice should be lightly sprinkled over the soil about once a month. Fertilizer can, however, burn your succulents leaves, as seen on the plant below.

    <h3>Getting Rid of Pests</h3>
        <p>As with any plant, indoor or outdoor, you're going to have a few pests that will plague your succulents. Even though succulents are very hard to kill, that doesn't mean they will be immune to pests. Here are some of the most common blights and how to treat them.
            <br><br><em id="note">Note: As with any remedies, it is better for the environment and your succulents to use natural versions. Any of these methods may have chemcial alternatives that you can purchase at your local nursery, but it is recommended you use the organic methods listed below.</em>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mealy bugs</strong>: Mealy bugs are distinguished by the white fuzz they leave on your plant. They may appear harmless at first, but if they continue reproducing they can literally suck the life out of your succulent. Treat them by using a Q-tipÂ® or an old paintbrush to brush rubbing alcohol over the white fuzz.</li>
                <li><strong>Spider mites</strong>: Spider mites are difficult to spot because they are extremely small and hard to see, but if you find that your succulent is developing yellow or rust colored scars then you know you have spider mites. They cannot be treated by regular pesticides because they are spiders and are immune to most chemicals that would kill off normal insects, so the way you can get rid of them is by removing their webs, which may appear between the leaves of your succulent, and taking the bugs themselves off your plant if you see any. You may want to take your succulent away from any other plant life lest the spider mites spread to those as well. If your succulent can withstand the high pressure, it helps to blast it with a hose to remove the mites.</li>
                <li><strong>Fungus gnats</strong>: Fungus gnats are the most common houseplant pest, and are similar to fruit flies except that they inhabit wet plant soil and drains. Adults lay eggs in the soil and the young will feed on the roots of your plants. Since the eggs are lain in the top quarter inch of moist soil, letting your succulents soil dry completely out before their next watering or covering it with sand, rocks, or glass chips can help prevent the gnats from reproducing. You can also create a trap for them by putting some vinegar in a glass, adding a couple of drops of dish soap, and covering it with some plastic wrap with holes in it. They will fly into the jar and become trapped because they are attracted to the vinegar.</li>
